### Usage

Example 1: Generating an  EDA and Datasummary Report from a CSV File.


```python

from sheetbuddy import SheetBuddy 

file_path_or_url = 'https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/airtravel.csv'
output_file_name = 'datasummary_report.xlsx'

sb = SheetBuddy(file_path_or_url)
sb.generate_eda_report(output_file_name)
```



Example 2: Generating an Datasummary & EDA Report from a Local JSON File.

```python

from sheetbuddy import SheetBuddy

file_path = 'path/to/your/data.json'
output_file_name = 'enter_your_desired_name.xlsx'

sb = SheetBuddy(file_path)
sb.generate_eda_report(output_file_name)

```
Example 3: Generating an Datasummary & EDA Report from a Local CSV File.

```python

from sheetbuddy import SheetBuddy

filename = 'your_local_path.csv'
outputfile = 'enter_your_desired_name.xlsx'

sb = SheetBuddy(filename)
sb.generate_eda_report(outputfile)

```
